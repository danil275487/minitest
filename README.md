Minitest is a sandbox survival game that does not care about you, built using [Luanti](https://luanti.org/) with a focus on <span title="Uses only the colors from Commodore 64, aims to use obscure Luanti configuration options for further customization">*visual aesthetics*</span> and distinct gameplay features.

> <details markdown='1'><summary>Starting out</summary>
> You wake up in a lush colorful world with no recollection of who or where you are, and you must thrive.
> Start off by gathering twigs and rocks, then using your trusty stone axe chop down trees, before making a crafting bench using 2 planks and sticks. Delve into caves to find better ores for equipment.

> **Section above will be removed in favor of a work-in-progress recipe book.**
